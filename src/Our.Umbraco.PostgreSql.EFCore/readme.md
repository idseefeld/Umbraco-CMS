# PostgreSQL Provider for Umbraco - EF Core Extention

```
ATTENTION: This is a community driven project and is not officially supported by Umbraco HQ.

Currently it is still in early development and should be used for testing and evaluation 
purposes only. And there are several issues in Umbraco's core that prevent full functionality 
when using PostgreSQL as the database. These are already addressed and will hopefully be 
fixed in future releases of Umbraco.

### Extention

This package is not useful in its own. It serves as an extension to the main PostgreSQL 
provider for Umbraco, which is available as a separate package. You can find it here: 
[Our.Umbraco.PostgreSql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Our.Umbraco.PostgreSql/)
